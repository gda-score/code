# code

This repo holds a variety of tools in support of the GDA Score Project (General Data Anonymity Score Project).

The code here is still very much alpha, and little effort has gone into making it easy for others to install and use.

The primary language is Python, and requires Python3.7 or later. API documentation for some of the tools can be found at https://gda-score.github.io/.
