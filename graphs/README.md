# graphs

Contains tools to build graphs from both defense and utility scores.

`gdaPlotDefense.py` build a defense graph. `gdaPlotUtiliity.py` builds a utility graph. The routines `makeDefenseGraphs.py` and `makeUtilityGraphs.py` read through all of the scores in `/code/attacks/attackResults` and `/code/utility/utilityResults` and place the corresponding graphs in those locations.
